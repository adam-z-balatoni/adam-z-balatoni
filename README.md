### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Currently studying Software Development at EÃ¶tvÃ¶s LorÃ¡nd University. I have one semester
left and I would like to further enrich my work experience during this period. I thrive to
understand the intricacies of C# development and get a much more in-depth comprehension
about the .NET ecosystem.

Looking for a suitable developer position as part of an energetic team of professionals while
completing my last semester online.
